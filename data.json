        "description": "As a UX designer, I collaborated with the University Council for Educational Administration (UCEA) to redesign their website. Previously, UCEA engaged MemberLeap to revamp the site, but significant issues with the website's infrastructure and content organization persisted. The project involved rebuilding the information architecture and designing an improved user experience, including layout and navigation, to create a more intuitive and user-friendly website. This initiative required leveraging UX design expertise to address complex challenges and deliver a solution that met the client's needs. This project stands as a testament to delivering impactful UX design solutions.",
